# Loop Patterns

This project demonstrates how to print different patterns using loops.  

## Patterns Included

- Diamond Pattern  
- Heart Pattern  
- Hollow Square  
- Inverted Triangle  
- Christmas Tree  

Each pattern is formed using loops and printed to the console.

## How It Works

- Loops are used to control rows and columns  
- Spaces and symbols are printed based on conditions  
- Nested loops help form the required shapes
